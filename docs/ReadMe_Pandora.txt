"Spout" is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer kuni.  It plays somewhat like Finnish cavefliers, except you have to erode your surroundings with your ship's exhuast.  It's great fun :-)

This is a Pandora port of Spout.  If you want to play this game on Windows, get it from the Japanese page above

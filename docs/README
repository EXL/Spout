"Spout" is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer kuni.  It plays somewhat like Finnish cavefliers, except you have to erode your surroundings with your ship's exhuast.  It's great fun :-)

This is a Unix port of Spout.  If you want to play this game on Windows, get it from the Japanese page above.



INSTALLATION:

First, you need SDL 1.2.6 or greater.  Then:

1) ./configure
2) make
3) ./spout

You can then copy the "spout" binary to a directory of your choosing, the game is entirely self contained.



PLAYING:

You can now play spout fullscreen, or at a greater resolution!

For fullscreen mode, simply start spout as "./spout f".

For alternate resolutions, start spout with an integer zoom factor, which will be the size of each particle.
For example:
  `./spout 1' -- very small!
  `./spout 2' -- this is the default
  `./spout 7' -- very big!

The larger the zoom factor, the worse performance will be :-(


At the title screen, hit spacebar to begin playing.  Your goal is to get as high as you possibly can, without crashing or your time running out.

Accelerate - spacebar, enter, z, x
Pause - escape
Exit - shift+escape
Rotate - left or right



Have fun :-)
